# Onboard project

My first project at Taqtile

## Environment and tools
Here are some basic information about the tools used in this project

    - Programming languages:
        - JavaScript (node version: 16.6.0);
        - Typescript; 
        - React (web);

    - Feature / Setup tools:
        - Prettier (for format);
        - Eslint (for problems in the code);

## Steps to run and debug

The project is basically made in React, so to run it you'll just have to write this command in the terminal: `npm start`, then the app will open in your browser.
    
Make sure that the terminal was open at the root of the project. 

Now you can modify the app and save it to refresh the page.
